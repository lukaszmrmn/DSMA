These are all the codes used to create the thesis. Although the Python codes are numbered, they were not executed perfectly in this order but rather intermixed and executed in a non-sequential manner. As a result, the code is not perfectly executable in a clear order, and some attention is needed to ensure everything runs correctly. However, all the results from the thesis should be fully replicable as provided.
